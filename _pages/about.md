I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of
Trento](http://www.unitn.it/en). I am a
member of the [SML research group](http://sml.disi.unitn.it/) and my PhD advisor
is Prof. [Andrea Passerini](http://disi.unitn.it/~passerini).

I am currently working at [Spotify](https://labs.spotify.com/) London as a
research intern, mentored by [Mounia Lalmas](https://mounia-lalmas.blog/) and
[Rishabh Mehrotra](http://rishabhmehrotra.com/).

<h2>Research</h2>

I work on several topics in Machine Learning, especially those concerning the
prediction of structures and complex objects, as well as applications thereof.
This research area is called structured-output prediction and is my current
research focus. I'm interested in both the "old fashioned" large-margin
approaches as well as recent deep architectures. I'm particularly interested in
embedding knowledge into structured prediction models, usually through some kind
of constraint solving/learning methods. During my PhD I applied this concept to
preference-based decision problems over combinatorial spaces of choices. The
resulting framework is called "constructive preference elicitation", and will be
the topic of my PhD thesis. My work touches several other areas of machine
learning which I have also come to know pretty well, such as Online Learning,
Convex Optimization, Preference Elicitation and Recommendation Systems.  Other
areas I am interested in are Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural
Language Processing, Dialogue Systems, Statistical Relational Learning and
Constraint Programming. Check out my [CV](/files/CV.pdf) for more details.

<h2>Short Bio</h2>

I got my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering in 2015 from Sapienza University of Rome
(Italy).  During my last year of masters I studied for a semester at the
University of Melbourne (Australia) and I worked on my masters thesis abroad at
the University of Oslo (Norway). There I worked with [Pierre
Lison](https://www.nr.no/~plison) on semantics of dialogue and dialogue systems.
After my graduation, I started my PhD at the University of Trento, a lovely
small city in northern Italy, full of brilliant scientists. Here I started
working with [Andrea Passerini](http://disi.unitn.it/~passerini) and [Stefano
Teso](http://disi.unitn.it/~teso) on constructive preference elicitation. During
my PhD I also traveled a lot, spending some time in Paris, hosted by [Paolo
Viappiani](http://www-desir.lip6.fr/~viappianip) at UPMC, and in Darmstadt,
hosted by [Kristian Kersting](http://www.ml.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) at TU
Darmstadt. In June 2018 I started a research internship at Spotify Research
London, where I work primarily on Contextual Bandits algorithms, together with
[Mounia Lalmas](https://mounia-lalmas.blog/) and [Rishabh
Mehrotra](http://rishabhmehrotra.com/).
